Motivation:

1.The current process of applying for rebates is not very clear and
hence most of the students just donâ€™t apply for it which in turn
wastes food,money etc.

2.If the mess workers know the number of students that are going to
miss the meal, it will be easy for them to estimate the amount of
food to be made.

3.The record of students are stored on a register, one page for each
student and most of the time these pages go blank at the end of
the month. This incurs a lot of wastage of paper which can be
easily avoided.

4. The effort for creating the mess bills of all the students at the end
of the month is a tedious task which can very well be made easy
using the app.Less efforts and better results for every one

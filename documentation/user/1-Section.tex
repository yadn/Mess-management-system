\section{Introduction}

In this project, we implemented a webapp using python with django framework. This webapp facilitates the process of applying for rebates and overhead. It provides an interface for students to apply for rebates and overhead. The mess worker or mess manager will be given a separate role in the app through which they can approve those requests. 

There will be three type of users:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Student : A Student can request for rebate and overhead through forms available in the pages accessible to him/her. He/She can also see the history of requests by him/her.
    \item Mess Worker : Mess worker here have access to his separate pages using which he can approve overhead requests as these requests are usually dealt by mess worker himself. We also provide the functionality of changing the prices of the meal.
    \item Mess Manager : Mess manager approves the rebate requests as done so in the current scenario. Rebate requests needs to be analyzed before approving that's why it requires mess manager to do that.
\end{enumerate}
\end{flushleft}

At the end of every month bills need to generated for which a lot of paperwork is needed. Since the app keeps track of overheads and rebates of every student, it makes the process of generating the monthly bills really easy.

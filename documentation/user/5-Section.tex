\begin{itemize}
    \item  As we can see that the app really is very practical and can be readily implemented in a Standard mess.
    \item There still are a lot of functionalities that can be implemented here like feature of special meal, dividing students on the basis of type of food they eat etc.
    \item The app can also be implemented on a large scale by adding a little more features and by making it a bit more flexible.

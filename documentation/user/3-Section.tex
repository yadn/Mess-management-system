\section{Motivation}
The following reasons were mostly important for us choosing and working on this project:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The current process of applying for rebates is not very clear and hence most of the students just don't apply for it which in turn wastes food,money etc.
    \item If the mess workers know the number of students that are going to miss the meal, it will be easy for them to estimate the amount of food to be made.
    \item The record of students are stored on a register, one page for each student and most of the time these pages go blank at the end of the month. This incurs a lot of wastage of paper which can be easily avoided.
    \item The effort for creating the mess bills of all the students at the end of the month is a tedious task which can very well be made easy using the app.Less efforts and better results for every one
\end{itemize}
